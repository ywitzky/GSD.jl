# Julia Wrapper for the GSD data format used by the HOOMD simulation package.

### Installation

The build step in deps/build.jl implicitly requires 'make' and 'gcc'.

### Usage

This library tries to be as close to the usage of the [original python](https://gsd.readthedocs.io/en/v3.2.1/hoomd-examples.html) implementation of the [gsd package](https://github.com/glotzerlab/gsd).
